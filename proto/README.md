# Miden node proto build

`proto-build` exposes protobuf `FileDescriptorSet` values for the public Miden node APIs. It is part of the
[Miden node](https://github.com/0xMiden/node#readme) repository.

## Role

This crate is intended for projects that need to generate gRPC bindings from the same protobuf API definitions used by
the node. It includes descriptors for the public RPC API and remote prover API, and an optional feature for internal
component APIs used by the Miden node workspace.

Raw protobuf files are included in this repository for projects that generate bindings in other languages. For project
navigation and documentation links, see the [primary README](https://github.com/0xMiden/node#readme).

## Crate Features

- `internal`: exposes file descriptors for internal node component APIs. These APIs are not intended for general client
  use.

This project is [MIT licensed](../LICENSE).
