/// A single-writer / multi-reader wrapper that provides lock-free access to shared state.
///
/// This type enables a pattern where one dedicated writer task mutates data while many reader
/// tasks concurrently access it, without any locks.
///
/// # Safety Contract
///
/// 1. **Single writer**: Only one task (the writer, serialized by a channel) may call
///    [`as_mut()`](Self::as_mut). This invariant is enforced architecturally, not by the type
///    system.
/// 2. **Publish barrier**: After completing all mutations, the writer performs an atomic store with
///    [`Release`](std::sync::atomic::Ordering::Release) ordering on a shared block counter.
/// 3. **Subscribe barrier**: Before calling [`as_ref()`](Self::as_ref), readers perform an atomic
///    load with [`Acquire`](std::sync::atomic::Ordering::Acquire) ordering on the same counter.
/// 4. The `Release`/`Acquire` pair establishes a *happens-before* relationship, guaranteeing that
///    all mutations performed before the `Release` store are visible to any reader that observes
///    the updated counter value.
///
/// Because the wrapped data structures are append-only or overlay-based (keyed by block number),
/// readers that observe an older counter value will simply query at that older block number,
/// which is safe.

// SAFETY: The single-writer invariant is enforced by the channel-based writer task architecture.
// Readers only call `as_ref()` which returns `&T`. The writer completes all mutations before
// advancing the atomic block counter (`Release`), and readers load the counter (`Acquire`)
// before accessing the data. This guarantees no data races.
