/// Instruments a function with Miden tracing defaults.
///
/// This is a restricted wrapper around [`tracing::instrument`]. It always applies `skip_all`,
/// requires a target from the Miden target allowlist, rejects `fields`, `skip`, `skip_all`, and
/// `err`, and records returned errors on the current span.
///
/// Supported arguments:
///
/// - target, required. The value must be an allowed path such as `rpc` or `store::database`.
/// - name, required. The value must be a static string literal such as `"store::get_block_header"`.
/// - level, required. The value must be one of `trace`, `debug`, `info`, `warn`, or `error`.
/// - `user`, optional. Marks the span for user-facing logs and registers it in the user-facing
///   metadata catalog.
///
/// The function's doc comments are also registered as the span metadata description. Function
/// arguments are never recorded automatically; record typed fields or objects explicitly inside the
/// function body.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```ignore
/// use miden_node_tracing::{Span, instrument};
///
/// /// Loads a block header from the store database.
/// #[instrument(store::database, "store::get_block_header", debug)]
/// async fn get_block_header(
///     block_num: miden_protocol::block::BlockNumber,
/// ) -> Result<(), anyhow::Error> {
///     Span::current().record_field(&block_num);
///
///     // Returning `Err` records the error on the current span.
///     Ok(())
/// }
/// ```
///

/// Records an event on the current Miden span with an explicit level.
///
/// The event respects the configured Miden target and level filters. Disabled targets and levels
/// avoid constructing the event attributes.
///
/// Syntax:
///
/// ```text
/// event!(<allowed target>, <message literal>, <level>, [user,] justification = "<why event>")
/// ```
///
/// Add `user` after the required level to mark the event for user-facing logs and register its
/// static message template in the user-facing metadata catalog. `justification` is required but is
/// only inspected at compile time; it should explain why this is an event instead of a span. The
/// macro returns an [`Event`] handle; record typed fields or objects on that handle and call
/// `emit()`, or let it emit when dropped.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```ignore
/// use miden_node_tracing::event;
///
/// let event = event!(
///     sequencer::block_builder,
///     "built block",
///     info,
///     user,
///     justification = "records a user-visible milestone after the build span closes",
/// );
/// event.record_field(&block_num);
/// event.record_object_as(&header, "block");
