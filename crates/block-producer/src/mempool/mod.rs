//! The [`Mempool`] is responsible for receiving transactions, and proposing transactions for
//! inclusion in batches, and proposing batches for inclusion in the next block.
//!
//! It performs these tasks by maintaining a dependency graph between all inflight transactions,
//! batches and blocks. A parent-child dependency edge between two nodes exists whenever the child
//! consumes a piece of state that the parent node created. To be more specific, node `A` is a
//! child of node `B`:
//!
//! - if `B` created an output note which is the input note of `A`, or
//! - if `B` updated an account to state `x'`, and `A` is updating this account from `x' -> x''`.
//!
//! Note that note dependency can only be tracked for unauthenticated input notes, because
//! authenticated notes have their IDs erased. This isn't a problem because authenticated notes are
//! guaranteed to be part of the committed state already by definition, and therefore we don't need
//! to concern ourselves with them. Double spending is also not possible because of nullifiers.
//!
//! Maintaining this dependency graph simplifies selecting transactions for new batches, and
//! selecting batches for new blocks. This follows from the blockchain requirement that each block
//! must build on the state of the previous block. This in turn implies that a child node can never
//! be committed in a block before all of its parents.
//!
//! The mempool also enforces that the graph contains no cycles i.e. that the dependency graph
//! is always a directed acyclic graph (DAG). While technically not illegal from a protocol
//! perspective, allowing cycles between nodes would require that all nodes within the cycle be
//! committed within the same block.
//!
//! While this is technically possible, the bookkeeping and implementation to allow this are
//! infeasible, and both blocks and batches have constraints. This is also undesirable since if
//! one component of such a cycle fails or expires, then all others would likewise need to be
//! reverted.
//!
//! The DAG nature of the graph is maintained by:
//!
//! - Ensuring incoming transactions are only ever appended to the current graph. This in turn
//!   implies that the transaction's state transition must build on top of the current mempool
//!   state.
//! - Parent/child edges between nodes in the graph are formed via state dependency.
//! - Transactions are proposed for batch inclusion only once _all_ its ancestors have already been
//!   included in a batch (or are part of the currently proposed batch).
//! - Similarly, batches are proposed for block inclusion once _all_ ancestors have been included in
//!   a block (or are part of the currently proposed block).
//! - Reverting a node reverts all descendants as well.
//!
//! The mempool maintains two DAGs: one for authenticated transactions awaiting batching and one for
//! batches awaiting inclusion in a block. As batches are selected, their constituent transactions
//! are marked in the transaction graph while the batch itself is appended to the batch graph. When
//! a block is proposed, the selected batches are staged in `pending_block` until the block is
//! either committed or rolled back.
//!
//! Recently committed batches are retained in `committed_blocks` according to the configured
//! `state_retention`, giving the mempool enough local history to validate newly authenticated
//! transactions even if the store and block producer momentarily disagree on the chain tip.
