# Miden validator

`miden-validator` is a Miden node binary that validates network activity before blocks are committed. It is part of the
Miden node repository; see the [repository README](https://github.com/0xMiden/node#readme) for the overall project
layout.

## Role

The validator is separate from `node` so that block construction and block validation can be operated as distinct
services. It verifies submitted transactions, validates proposed blocks, and signs blocks that satisfy the validator's
checks.

The validator is also responsible for creating and signing the genesis block during bootstrap. That signed genesis block
is then used to initialize the node and other services that need trusted genesis state.

## Operation

The validator expects to operate as an internal service within a Miden network's infrastructure and exposes a gRPC API
for use by trusted internal nodes.

It supports local development keys and KMS-backed signing for deployments that need external key management.
