# Miden remote prover

`miden-remote-prover` is a gRPC server for generating Miden transaction, batch, or block proofs on a machine separate
from the caller. It is part of the Miden node repository; see the
[repository README](https://github.com/0xMiden/node#readme) for the overall project layout.

## Role

Remote proving lets weaker clients or node components offload expensive proof generation to a machine with more suitable
resources. Each server instance is configured for one proof type. Requests are accepted up to a configured capacity and
processed by the prover service.

The service is intentionally small: it provides the proving API, worker status API, gRPC health checking, gRPC
reflection, gRPC-Web support, and OpenTelemetry tracing. More complex proxying or load-balancing should be handled
outside this binary.

The protobuf service definition is versioned with the Miden node repository. When integrating directly with the
protocol, use definitions matching the deployed binary. For project navigation and documentation links, see the
[primary README](https://github.com/0xMiden/node#readme).
