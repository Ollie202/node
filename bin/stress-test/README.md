# Miden stress test

This crate contains a binary for running Miden node stress tests.

## Seed Store

This command seeds a store with newly generated accounts. For each block, it first creates a faucet transaction that sends assets to multiple accounts by emitting notes, then adds transactions that consume these notes for each new account. As a result, the seeded store files are placed in the given data directory, including a dump file with all the newly created accounts ids.

Once it's finished, it prints out several metrics.

After building the binary, you can run the following command to generate one million accounts:

`miden-node-stress-test seed-store --data-directory ./data --num-accounts 1000000`

The store file will then be located at `./data/miden-store.sqlite3`.

The seed data can be tuned for account-detail benchmarks:

- `--public-accounts-percentage` controls how many generated accounts are public. The default is `0`.
- `--storage-map-entries` adds a deterministic storage map with the given number of entries to every public account. The default is `0`.
- `--vault-entries` adds the given number of distinct fungible assets to every public account's vault. The default is `1`, and the value must fit within the protocol note asset limit.
- `--account-update-blocks` appends the given number of blocks after account initialization. These blocks randomly update existing accounts and rotate updates through the seeded storage-map entries. The default is `0`.

For example, this creates public accounts with storage maps, multiple vault assets, and additional account-update history:

```bash
miden-node-stress-test seed-store \
  --data-directory ./data \
  --num-accounts 100000 \
  --public-accounts-percentage 50 \
  --storage-map-entries 128 \
  --vault-entries 5 \
  --account-update-blocks 100
```

## Benchmark Store

This command allows to run stress tests against the Store component. These tests use the dump file with accounts ids created when seeding the store, so be sure to run the `seed-store` command beforehand.

The endpoints that you can test are:
- `load-state`
- `get-account`
- `sync-notes`
- `sync-nullifiers`
- `sync-transactions`
- `sync-chain-mmr`

Most benchmarks accept options to control the number of iterations and concurrency level. The `load-state` endpoint is different - it simply measures the one-time startup cost of loading the state from disk.

The `get-account` benchmark uses the account id dump created by `seed-store`, selects public accounts, and requests account details from the store. Each request asks for vault details and all entries from a storage map slot. By default, it uses the slot created by `--storage-map-entries`: `miden::mock::stress_test::map`. You can request a different slot with `--storage-map-slot`.

**Note on Concurrency**: For request benchmarks, the concurrency parameter controls how many requests are sent in parallel to the store. Since these benchmarks run against a local store (no network overhead), higher concurrency values can help identify bottlenecks in the store's internal processing. The latency measurements exclude network time and represent pure store processing time.

Example usage:

```bash
miden-node-stress-test benchmark-store \
  --data-directory ./data \
  --iterations 10000 \
  --concurrency 16 \
  sync-notes
```

To benchmark public account detail loading, seed public accounts first and then run:

```bash
miden-node-stress-test benchmark-store \
  --data-directory ./data \
  --iterations 10000 \
  --concurrency 16 \
  get-account
```

### Results

The following results were obtained using a store with 100k accounts, half of which are public.

Using the store seed command:
```bash
# Using 100k accounts, half are public
$ miden-node-stress-test seed-store --data-directory data --num-accounts 100000 --public-accounts-percentage 50

Current results of the store stress-tests:

**Performance Note**: The latency measurements below represent pure store processing time (no network overhead).

*The following results were obtained after seeding the store with the command used previously.*

- load-state
``` bash
$ miden-node-stress-test benchmark-store --data-directory ./data load-state

State loaded in 42.959271667s

**Performance Note**: The load-state benchmark shows that account tree loading (~21.3s) and nullifier tree loading (~21.5s) are the primary bottlenecks, while MMR loading and database connection are negligible (<3ms each).
