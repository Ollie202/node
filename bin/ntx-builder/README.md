# Miden network transaction builder

`miden-ntx-builder` is a Miden node binary that creates network transactions for network accounts. It is part of the
Miden node repository; see the [repository README](https://github.com/0xMiden/node#readme) for the overall project
layout.

## Role

The network transaction builder syncs blocks from an upstream node, tracking network notes and accounts. It starts
per-account workers for network accounts with pending work. Each worker selects viable notes, constructs a transaction,
proves it, and submits the proven transaction back through the upstream node's RPC API.

The builder can use a remote transaction prover through `miden-remote-prover`, or fall back to in-process proving where
appropriate for local development. It also exposes an internal gRPC API that the node RPC component can use for
network-note status queries.

## Operation

The builder has its own persistent database and must be initialized from the same trusted genesis block as the rest of
the network before it starts. In a complete node deployment, `node` connects to this service so network-note status can
be exposed through the public RPC API.
