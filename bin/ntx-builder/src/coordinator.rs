// COORDINATOR
// ================================================================================================

/// Coordinator for managing [`AccountActor`] instances, tasks, and notifications.
///
/// The `Coordinator` is the central orchestrator of the network transaction builder system.
/// It manages the lifecycle of account actors. Each actor is responsible for handling transactions
/// for a specific network account. The coordinator provides the following core
/// functionality:
///
/// ## Actor Management
/// - Spawns new [`AccountActor`] instances for network accounts as needed.
/// - Maintains a registry of active actors with their notification handles.
/// - Gracefully handles actor shutdown and cleanup when actors complete or fail.
/// - Monitors actor tasks through a join set to detect completion or errors.
///
/// ## Event Notification
/// - Notifies actors via a shared [`Notify`] when state may have changed.
/// - The DB is the source of truth: actors re-evaluate their state from DB on notification.
/// - Notifications are coalesced: [`Notify`] stores at most one permit, so multiple notifications
///   while an actor is busy result in a single wake-up.
///
/// ## Resource Management
/// - Controls transaction concurrency across all network accounts using a semaphore.
/// - Prevents resource exhaustion by limiting simultaneous transaction processing.
///
/// ## Actor Lifecycle
/// - Actors that have been idle for longer than the idle timeout deactivate themselves.
/// - When an actor deactivates, the coordinator checks if a notification arrived just as the actor
///   timed out. If so, the actor is respawned immediately.
/// - Deactivated actors are re-spawned when [`Coordinator::send_targeted`] detects notes targeting
///   an account without an active actor.
///
/// The coordinator operates in an event-driven manner:
/// 1. Network accounts are registered and actors spawned as needed.
/// 2. Mempool events are written to DB, then actors are notified.
/// 3. Actor completion/failure events are monitored and handled.
/// 4. Failed or completed actors are cleaned up from the registry.
pub struct Coordinator {
    /// Mapping of network account IDs to their notification handles.
